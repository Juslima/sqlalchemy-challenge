# Part 1: Analyze and Explore the Climate Data

The provided code is a Python script that uses SQLAlchemy ORM to interact with a SQLite database containing weather data for Hawaii. It performs exploratory analysis on precipitation and station data.

The necessary libraries are imported, including Matplotlib, NumPy, Pandas, and SQLAlchemy.
The script establishes a connection to the "hawaii.sqlite" database using SQLAlchemy's create_engine function.
The database tables are reflected and mapped to Python classes using the automap_base function.
Two classes, Measurement and Station, are assigned references to the corresponding tables in the database.
A session is created to link Python with the database.
# Exploratory Precipitation Analysis:
The most recent date in the dataset is queried and stored, the most recent date in the dataset is '2017-08-23'.
The date one year before the most recent date is calculated.
A query is performed to retrieve the precipitation data for the last 12 months.
The query results are saved as a Pandas DataFrame and sorted by date.
The precipitation data is plotted using Matplotlib.
Summary statistics for the precipitation data are calculated using Pandas:
- Count: 2021
- Mean: 0.177279 inches
- Standard Deviation: 0.461190 inches
- Minimum: 0.000000 inches
- 25th Percentile: 0.000000 inches
- Median (50th Percentile): 0.020000 inches
- 75th Percentile: 0.130000 inches
- Maximum: 6.700000 inches
# Exploratory Station Analysis:
The total number of stations in the dataset is calculated and printed, the total number of stations in the dataset is 9.
The most active stations are determined by counting the number of rows for each station and ordering them in descending order.
For the most active station (USC00519281), the lowest, highest, and average temperature are:
- Lowest Temperature: 54.0°F
- Highest Temperature: 85.0°F
- Average Temperature: 71.66°F

The temperature observations (tobs) for the last 12 months of the most active station (USC00519281) are plotted as a histogram.
The code includes concise comments that provide relevant explanations for each step, making it easy for other developers to understand and modify the code.
